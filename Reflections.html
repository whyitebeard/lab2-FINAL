This would lead you unto unknown path which you can no longer find your way to progress and time was wasted. Due to these circumstances, we, as a team, can clearly state that the lack of visualization, characterization, and information leads to a failed project. <br><br>But, hang on, we've also prevented and took precautions to avoid any unnecessary mistakes as we thoroughly progress and critically think about our next steps, goals perhaps.<br><br>I’ve gathered different ideas from other groups such as, who will be our target market, what lacks on the application, can you still cope-up on the demand of its service, etc. which will be a great catalyst for us to furtherly understand our problem and stand with our conviction.<br><br>Knowing that there is no perfect application cease to exist, we will keep on providing features and updates that will cover the want/s or need/s of the society by continuously consolidating on our target market as well as seeking help to those who are already professional in this particular matter. <br><br>As an I.T student, who’s looking forward to acquire more&nbsp;knowledge, skills, and solutions for the benefit of the society, I must say that we can not answer a question if we do not know the problem and that is why, it is important to explore the societies need/s or want/s or even predict the technology beyond our comprehension. Because we are humans, and we have unlimited time to progress and exceed the worlds’ limitation. <br><br>That being said, I shall comply to the requirements of the professor and continue to inspire my colleagues as well as our predecessors. </p>

In addition, you can clearly navigate the whereabouts of your file on this particular storage called “repository” which significantly helped students to maintain a stable connection with their respective professor. <br><br>Not only that we can use github for this matter, but heroku as well which mainly focuses on linking the mainstream file coming from github on its own server by linking in.<br><br><div></div><div>Both web application provided the “security” for any threat/s coming from different malware, ransomware, viruses, etc. that greatly affect the file of the end-user to its recipient.

But, this doesn’t stop here due to the fact that we also have to cater the preferences of the users which is seemly impossible since each person has it’s own kind of perspective for a particular application. 
<div>
</div><div>This is what we have to provide solution with, to ponder the need/s or want/s of our target audience which should incline on our objective because if we failed to produce the quality of interface users expected to, well its safe to say that you already lost the competition as well as your time.
</div><div>
</div><div>We can probably say that a minimalistic, yet precise user interface without exaggerated variables would suffice the audience interest to test our application. It just has to be designed relatively to the main goal of the application, for example our objective would be to create an application which correlates the different places in luzon. Given this scenario we should not include places for visayas and mindanao because it’s not necessary, same with the user interface.
</div><div>
</div><div>I hereby end my reflection, there are no longer information that I can reflect with. But, it set as an high importance to produce a good quality of UI which users can easily interact and interpret the features of this app.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">It was a long journey – started from scratch without a single guidance of previous officers it was hard but, we made it. At the pinnacle of each event I, as a host, organizer, officer, of three different IT organization, was happy to see their smile. Mentally and physically exhausted with less than 5 hours of sleep for three consecutive days just to make script, props, attend meetings, and balance workload as a student. <br><br>It seems that my personality as a “lazy” individual was removed – instantly, since at the beginning of my college days I knew that I would not be joining extracurricular activities, yet, here I am.<br><br> Honestly, I did not expect myself getting through these experiences because I have set my mind to focus on my studies on/off school and do my daily activities as an individual but, organization kick-in the door and shouted “You belong here”. 
<br><br><div>There were different hardships that I had encountered within this week, especially when I was appointed as a host at the same day and time for Ms. Rhea’s event given about less than 30 minutes to prepare before the said seminar. </div><br><div>It is indeed hard for me since I usually prepare 1 or 2 day/s before the event happens but, as they say, with great responsibility comes with great reliability – and so I stood up on the floor made some mistakes because of nervousness, luckily I kept my presence of my mind and apply all the necessary lessons that I’ve learned in the past and continue my role as a host. 
</div><div><br></div><div>After SoCIT Fest, I knew unto myself that, studying while having fun is not a bad idea at all. It makes you human compared when you do the same tasks every day and feel like a programmed robot. It doesn’t hurt to be a human, that is why students should know that college is not all about getting high grades, attending class, and wait ‘til class are suspended but, more than the school can offer is for us to be humans.

On the first-half, I was able to express my own ideas – virtually and enhance it by listening to Ms. Jen’s advices. <br><br>It made me realize that technology continues to develop, competitors are around the world and here I am still sitting and struggling to be a different version of other developers since it is possible that most of my ideas are already published without my knowledge. <br><br>But, the course did not allowed me to stop progressing to overcome my hardship on venting out the justification on why I want to pursue this solution that I have provided on our last project, it drills me to look for different rooms to improve on since I should be a continuous learner in order to survive the industry as well as to strive for my own company.<br><br> I hope to continue and improve my logical way of thinking ideas, design which would entice investors and individuals to use my future application or invention.
<br><br>There’s nothing more or less to say in my reflection since this is subjectively my perspective on this class.&nbsp;<br></p>
